Boris Gruys gives an extremely limited, Eurocentric, and chauvinist interpretation of the relationship between art and activism.
Despite some interesting points, he frequently makes sweeping generalizations which hardly take account of the differing class character of art made by social groups in distinct social positions under capitalism, for example: "contemporary art activism does not rush to abandon art but, rather, tries to make art itself useful. This is a historically new position."
It would appear that Gruys has never heard of socially engaged artists like Emory Douglas of the Black Panthers, Gil Scott-Heron, Nina Simone, Billie Holiday, etc.
The idea that trying to make art itself useful is a historically new position is laughable.

The claim that "Contemporary art activism has, on the contrary [to the Soviet Union supported Russian avant-garde of the 1920s], no reason to believe in external political support."
Yet, some of today's activist art does indeed gain the support of imperialist political powers -- which, it is again worth emphasizing, are quite different from a progressive power like the Soviet Union of the 1920s.
I could call Molly Crabapple out of her name, but I don't even want to spend the time digging up the receipts.

Interesting points in the essay about the lack of distinction between art and technology were almost immediately destroyed by the attempt to impose a new, equally artificial distinction between art and design.
In typically Eurocentric fashion, Gruys locates everything modern and interesting in the French Revolution -- with not a word for, say, the Haitians who made those enormous events possible.
More broadly, from reading this article, you would literally never know that African, Asian, and indigenous American peoples had their own art traditions with political dimensions, or what were the significant events and influences in their formation.

Points that would be obvious to someone with even the most cursory familiarity with any of these traditions seem to elude Gruys.
For example, this quote contains kernels of great insight: "Already during the nineteenth century, museums were often compared to cemeteries, and museum curators to gravediggers. However, the museum is much more of a cemetery than any real cemetery. Real cemeteries do not expose the corpses of the dead; they conceal them."
I would go on to elaborate the obvious-to-me connections to the vampiric nature of capitalism already used as a metaphor at least as early as Marx, and the pillage of the Global South which made the imperialist nations rich, as still expressed in a site such as the British Museum made wealthy by grave-robbing.
I distinctly recall a conversation with a worker at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo speaking with such vehemence and disgust at the plunder of cultural heritage on display in London.
In this land, we could have a related discussion about the function of institutions such as the Museum of the American Indian here in New York City in justifying settler-colonialism by depicting indigenous peoples as dead, when in fact Native peoples are still here.
But Gruys passes over such connections in silence and instead goes on to make more bizarre claims such as "art has been understood as the defunctionalized and publicly exhibited corpse of the past. This understanding of art determined postrevolutionary art strategies—until now."
Understood by who?
Determined whose strategies?
Literally no one I know of, which is not to say that it is not true or applicable somewhere.
It is to say that Gruys' perspective is so painfully limited that I question whether it is worth extracting any value from it rather than starting fresh.

In that perspective, I conclude this reflection with the following notes rather than giving an extensive critique of the remainder of Gruys' work.
(I will just note that a disability justice conception appears superior in every way to Gruys' framing here: "Only if we learn to aestheticize the lack of gifts as well as the presence of gifts, and thus not differentiate between victory and failure, do we escape the theoretical blockage that endangers contemporary art activism.")
I have an alternative explanation to Gruys' for the unpopularity of contemporary art: people who already struggle with oppression are not interested in the further ugliness of art characterized by the perspectives of their oppressors.
Popular culture, for all its reactionary reinforcement of oppressive status quo hierarchies, does at least offer some beauty and escape.
What revolutionary art would offer would be different from both.
There is nothing revolutionary about imagining the current system failing if your view does not also entail some alternative future for the people, arrived at by their collective efforts.
Gruys says "Total aestheticization means that we see the current status quo as already dead, already abolished. And it means further that every action that is directed towards the stabilization of the status quo will ultimately show itself as ineffective—and every action that is directed towards the destruction of the status quo will ultimately succeed. Thus, total aestheticization not only does not preclude political action; it creates an ultimate horizon for successful political action, if this action has a revolutionary perspective."
I think this is a truly terrible perspective and conclusion.
The plain fact is that the status quo is not already abolished; witness the continuing need for abolitionist movements against the continuation of slavery in the guise of police and prisons for a clear example of how long institutions from the past linger on.
It is a clear historical reality that not every reactionary effort fails and not every revolutionary action succeeds.
Total aestheticization appears to me as a useless terrible horizon for political action with no apparent basis in collectivity, democracy, or true liberation and and I would strongly recommend against it to everyone.
Instead, maybe talk to your community, see what's good with their fears and hopes, reflect on your own, consider all of your relationships, and act.
