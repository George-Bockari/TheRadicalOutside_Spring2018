In the first paragraph of _On Art Activism_, Groys explains that art activism,
unlike critical art, seeks to be more than critical. However, what Groys describes 
as art activism - defunctionalizing the present and showing the status quo as already
dead and abolished is doing just that. The art activism he describes seems incapable
of doing what he says art activism should - "change living conditions in economically
underdeveloped areas, raise ecological concerns, offer access to culture and education 
for the populations of poor countries and regions, attract attention to the plight of 
illegal immigrants, improve the conditions of people working in art institutions..." 
How can you make change in the present by destroying it? So art activism does not do the 
work that Groys explains in the first paragraph but rather, as he explains towards the end,
might provide a pathway for change. “Total aestheticization means that we see the current 
status quo as already dead, already abolished. And it means further that every action that
is directed towards the stabilization of the status quo will ultimately show itself as 
ineffective—and every action that is directed towards the destruction of the status quo 
will ultimately succeed." However, the scale Groys describes seems too magnificent. While 
the scale of destruction is huge (society as we know it or to give a more specific example
soviet communism), interaction with art still happens on a small, individual level if it's not
supported by the government ("Contemporary art activism has, on the contrary,no reason to 
believe in external political support.") [Hannah Black](http://arcadiamissa.com/hannah-black/), 
a visual artist says "When we're talking about art changing anything, we're talking about art 
changing a person, and what that person might do in response to this encounter with a work."
It's more aligned with the idea of "macroinfluences" that Morehshin mentioned and reminds me of 
something Kelli said in class which was that sometimes "activism is inching towards change by 
making things feel more real and possible." 


This is a bit of an aside:

The reading, particularly the lines about corpses ("art has been understood as the defunctionalized and publicly exhibited corpse of the past.") got me thinking about what gets destroyed when making art - What function is no longer realized?
About a year ago, there were [protests of Dana Schutz's](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/arts/design/painting-of-emmett-till-at-whitney-biennial-draws-protests.html) painting of Emmett Till. I read an [interview](https://hyperallergic.com/368012/what-does-it-mean-to-be-black-and-look-at-this-a-scholar-reflects-on-the-dana-schutz-controversy/) with Christina Sharpe about it and she said "So Mamie Till (Emmett's mother) refuses to have those images not be shown. And she says (this isn’t a direct quote): Look at what they did to my son. This is my son. Look at what they did to him. She insists that the violence that he has been subject to be seen, unobscured. It seems to me that what Dana Schutz has done is to take that unobscured violence and make it abstract. Mamie Till wanted to make violence real. And that thing — white supremacy, violent abduction, murder — that Mamie Till wanted to make absolutely clear is abstracted in Schutz’s work, and in her defense of the work." Making the violence real was the function that was removed by abstract art. Should every status 
quo be defunctionalized or is there value in sitting and reckoning with the horror of the present and the past?
