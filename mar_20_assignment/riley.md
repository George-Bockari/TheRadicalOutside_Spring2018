Groys isn't right. I nearly read through the entire essay before remembering this. I noticed it early on, but I was still fighting tooth and nail through each paragraph. As a result, my first reading took a long time. I imagine that comes from a lack of exposure to this self-confident, erudite style of writing. More seasoned readers have probably internalized this tradition and can play with the underlying ideas without first having to shake the pretense of correctness. Once I shifted my interpretation of the ideas presented as an invitation for discourse, I could start engaging more meaningfully. The second read was more fruitful.
