Groys isn't right. I nearly read through the entire essay before remembering this. I noticed it early on, but I was still fighting tooth and nail through each paragraph. As a result, my first reading took a long time. I imagine that comes from a lack of exposure to this self-confident, erudite style of writing. More seasoned readers have probably internalized this tradition and can play with the underlying ideas without first having to shake the pretense of correctness. Once I shifted my interpretation of the ideas presented as an invitation for discourse, I could start engaging more meaningfully. The second read was more fruitful.

What struck me during my first read was the author's limited definition of art and activism. Looking to history, Groys's analysis sounds like erasure. It's a convenient lens through which to present his idea, but it seems necessary for any Unified Theory of Political Art to acknowledge that across human civilization, art existed before the French Revolution and took many forms. The ideas presented also fall short of explaining how the memetic, nihilistic tendency of net art, for example, can rely "on its own networks" _with_ "external political support"; how it can exist both as condemnation and brace for existing power structures.

The dichotomies laid out by Groys – art vs. design, design vs. technology, modernism, aestheticization, and other – are easy to chip away at. And the assertion that contemporary art is free from "the design of power and wealth" is tenuous. His sweeping claim that "since the French Revolution, art has been understood as the defunctionalized and publicly exhibited corpse of the past" seems simplistic and overly optimistic. Exhale. Grab a glass of water. Come back. Read again.

My second reading was no less critical, but perhaps more accommodating. I found Groys's style, in some ways, refreshing. His cavalier, sweeping statements felt in some ways a more honest representation of where opinions come from; less protected behind parapets of footnotes than contemporary papers.

Standing on its own, I think the point that "aestheticization... often refers to different and even opposing theoretical and political operations" is valid and interesting. It's given me more to think about as I try to define my own position within art and activism. This reading raised difficult questions about goals, impact, visibility, and complacency.

In closing, I think Groys's criticism of Walter Benjamin:

> "But there is still one crucial question here: How reliable is Marinetti as a witness?"

applies equally as well to his own writing. He presents a myopic perspective as comprehensive. I'm glad I'm getting more exposure to academic writing on art history and media theory. The binaries presented here were a useful foil for my own perspectives, and the piece presented some ideas that were novel to me. I'm still trying to distill the personal implications for me as an artist.

Notes that didn't make it in:

Breaking: self-assured man quotes self-assured dead men

"I would argue that aestheticization is a much more radical form of death that traditional iconoclasm." Divergent perspectives? Interpretation of satire? Etc.

"the artists of the historical avant-garde were interested in technological, industrialized modernity. However, they were interested in technological modernity only with the goal of aestheticizing modernity, defunctionalizing it, to reveal the ideology of progress as phantasmal and absurd." I don't buy it. Contrast with Vera Molnar: "for some decades now more and more interesting experiments are being attempted in scientific-aesthetic laboratories (to register, for example, someone's eye movements while viewing a painting) to try to reach some understanding of this unknown phenomenon that would be very important to the visual arts." ("My Mother's Letters", 1994)

"Thus, modern and contemporary art allows us to look at the historical period in which we live from the perspective of its end." I like this. Design moves forward from today to the end. Art moves from the end back to today.

"Indeed, a genuine political transformation cannot be achieved according to the same logic of talent, effort, and competition on which the current market economy is based, but only by metanoia and kenosis—by a U-turn against the movement of progress, a U-turn against the pressure of upward mobility. Only in this way can we escape the pressure of our own gifts and talents, which enslaves and exhausts us by pushing us to climb one mountain after another." Interesting points; seems like several distinct ideas knotted together. Agree that critical analysis re: capitalist strategies leaking into revolution is important. Agree with the problematic social Darwinism, neoliberalism of celebrating "giftedness". Unclear what the actual proposal here is?

Is the difference between art and design in its application or its essence? does design always support the system? Are tactics not more design than art?

I think the type of art described as "the art of the Old Regimes of Europe before the French Revolution—here we also find only religious design, or the design of power and wealth." is still being made. "Art also accepts the status quo—but it accepts it as a corpse, after its transformation into a mere representation." – sweeping, optimistic, narrow. Maybe that's the point of this essay, to distill the narrow distinction. But then is this useful commentary on real society?
