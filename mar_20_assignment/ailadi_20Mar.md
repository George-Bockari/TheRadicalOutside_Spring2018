Don’t museum do to art activists what the French Revolutionary did to the design of Old Regimes?

Despite I don’t resonae with the aesthetic of graffiti, i recognize their act of protest, their attempt at reappropriation of the public space and the denouce of the institutionalisation of elitarian property. And I think their protest dies when they exhibit in Museum, to be appreciated by the same elite they wanted to criticize.

I still see the potential of changing the status quo in the design practice of speculative and critical design. I wish Boris Groys would have expanded on examples of recognized art activism that stay alive after they are aestheticized by the art institutions. Also I wish he expanded on the comparison between the results that art activism want to attain in comparison with social activists.
