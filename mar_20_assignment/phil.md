I cannot write a response to Groys’ article because I cannot understand it, so instead I have this cop-out meta-reflection.

I found myself saving a lot of passages that had problems for me—unsubstantiated claims, gross generalizations, seeming contradictions—I guess with some idea of compiling a character assault on Groys, evidenced by “the bad parts”. If I can attack the author and article as being non-sensical and full of contradictions, maybe I can throw them away without having to address the core ideas directly. Unfortunately for me, this collection was difficult to assemble into a coherent attack: the contradictions seem to have almost a self-awareness suggesting that maybe, in fact, I just didn’t get it. Which is true.

But, maybe I can start with the beginning:

> Art activists do want to be useful, to change the world, to make the world a better place—but at the same time, they do not want to cease being artists. And this is the point where theoretical, political, and even purely practical problems arise.

How can anyone be useful, change the world, make it a better place? The sentence seems to imply that there is some clear-cut, non-artistic path to doing so, and that, to do so as an artist is to modify some understood kind of activity. If that’s the premise, then I expect the article to argue that, for any activist goal ‘x’, you can achieve ‘x’ more efficiently without art than with it. The article does not argue this, and I can’t find another way past it, so I think this is where my problems with the whole article stem.
