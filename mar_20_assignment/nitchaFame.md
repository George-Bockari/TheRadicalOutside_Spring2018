The reading On Art Activism by Boris Groys is bringing us back to the root of design and art, or at least, the references and explanations are reasonable enough to accompany with his thought in this reading. I tie this to my own experience and compare his definition with mine, which I've always struggle to categorize art and design and find the sharp line to divide it from another, where his explanation is clear some more space in the gray area up .

The point of view of aestheticizing art since in French Revolutionary is fascinating. It got me thinking of art in general sense, in a historical museum, as an expose corpse-form of the Old Regime, which makes a lot of sense; always feel cannot associate, not necessary means negative impression. While postmodern, or to be specific, today-art seems to be different.

'Only if we learn to aestheticize the lack of gifts as well as the presence of gifts, and thus not differentiate between victory and failure, do we escape the theoretical blockage that endangers contemporary art activism.'

One more point that Groys seems to point out subtlely, aestheticizing in the past and now systematically different that one is from the top of view the system, while the other from the bottom.
