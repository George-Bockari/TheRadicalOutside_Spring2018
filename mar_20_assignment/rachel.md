In my education as a graphic designer, a distinction was always made between design and art. Design being separate from art because design serves a functional purpose, while art is simply meant to be appreciated or beheld. A popular debate in my classes questioned whether design could be considered art and vice versa.

One thing that struck me in this article were the different attitudes that inspire the different schools or categories of art. Specifically, modern and contemporary art being disliked because it sought to break down the order of something. Why do we classify art at all? What if we rid ourselves of these categories? What if we displayed a jc leyendecker next to a yayoi kusama, or an Andy Warhol next to a Rembrandt? Does the art lose meaning without its label as classical, surreal, contemporary, etc?
