I appreciated the distinctions made about the concept of "aestheticization" when applied to different contexts. This is not something I had thought about before, though it felt intuitive and a helpful framing tool: are we making something more ubiquitous, or looking back at it as part of the past. I would paraphrase these distinctions as: when you make something smooth and shiny it wends our way into our lives (it is well-designed); when you put a frame around it, it is dead (art beyond resurrection).

The distinction is between "aspirational aesthetics", which make you want to be a part of a thing; and "the thing itself, sitting naked on a pedestal", which invites you to look at it from a place of separation.  Do you "want it"/want to "be it"? Or do you see it. (And therefore have an ability to change it, leave it behind).

Our current political moment is an object lesson in different uses of aesthetics attempting to define/design what we see.  Speaking of "the thing itself, sitting naked on a pedestal", both prior and post the 2016 election, artists began depicting the nominee (and later the President) as physically naked and injecting that imagery into public places. Joshua Monroe created 5 naked statues of Trump which were installed in Union Square and four other cities.  Artist Ilma Gore painted a naked picture of Trump and received death threats as well as being punched in the face. This week's New Yorker cover by Barry Blitt again features the president (emperor) with no clothes.

While there are problems with this type of representation, specifically body-shaming and value judgments on gender, I find it interesting that in this particular cases the art against Trump has made the choice to rip the clothes off. I feel this is a reaction less to the toxic masculinity with which he leads, but to the "political design choices" that are coming out of the his administration.  

A few examples.  Trump is planning a parade. This is an aestheticization of politics in which there will be uniforms, marching, trumpets, and military equipment. Designed to make people swoon, feel drawn towards a group, a national identity, as well as to project inevitability and strength (in its most naive form).  Another design choice: his movement is represented by salt-of-the-earth "MAGA" hats that piggyback on imagery of the John Deere tractor heartland, baseball ("the american past-time"), and so-called "ordinary people". Trump is trying to dress a monster in the finest of whites, pun intended: the most visible protest artwork that I have seen regarding his person is to rip off the garments to reveal what is underneath.

There is a monster amongst us and inside of us: it is simultaneoulsy being dressed and undressed.

So on one hand you have aestheticization attempting to dress something, on the other, to undress it.  The "emperor's new clothes" deconstructions are attempting to shine a bright light on something that for many people has been (appallingly) seductive. Turn the light on and end the party as it were.

So, art, especially activist art, is also a fight about where the frame goes, and who gets to place it.

Simply framing something as if it is art (aestheticized, negated, "nonexistent for practical purposes") doesn't mean that it will have the impact the artist desires: not everyone is ready or willing to see.  Perhaps there needs to be a confluence of the right imagery and the ability to see -- the "right time"?  The case the author makes is that this is possible: art is not a tool to pretty something up and thus pull punches, it can be the knock-out-punch itself.

Concepts in the writing that I did not understand:

* What does this mean: "First of all, only self-contradictory practices are true in a deeper sense of the word. "

* This confuses me: "However, it is obvious that the belief in natural gifts and creativity is the worst form of social Darwinism, biologism, and, actually, neoliberalism, with its notion of human capital. In his lectures on the “birth of biopolitics,” "

* I got lost in the middle about human talent & capital:
"The reason for this is simple: according to Beuys, a human being is creative because nature gave him/her the initial human capital—precisely the capacity to be creative. So art practice remains dependent on nature—and, thus, on the unequal distribution of natural gifts."

* the relevance of the futurist manifesto

### Quotes and mis-quotes from the writing:

"A certain intellectual tradition rooted in the writings of Walter Benjamin and Guy Debord states that the aestheticization and spectacularization of politics, including political protest, are bad things because they divert attention away from the practical goals of political protest and towards its aesthetic form. And this means that art cannot be used as a medium of a genuine political protest—because the use of art for political action necessarily aestheticizes this action, turns this action into a spectacle and, thus, neutralizes the practical effect of this action."

Argument: 
people ("") abandoned art but now trying to make it useful
contemporary art activism has "no reason to believe in external political support"

aestheticization
* in design, make an object more useful, spread the status quo
* of politics -- a way to make some movement "more attractive" (e.g. Nazis have nice uniforms, torchlight parades, etc)
* artistic -- "the death of design" -- aestheticized -- negated, nonexistent for practical purposes -- 

"I would argue that aestheticization is a much more radical form of death that traditional iconoclasm"

museums are the "real cemetaries" by exposing the corpses of the dead, "definitive death", "the aestheticized material corpse functions as a testimony to the impossibility of resurrection. "

"Thus, since the French Revolution, art has been understood as the defunctionalized and publicly exhibited corpse of the past"

"the difference between the aestheticization of politics rooted in modern art and the politicization of aesthetics rooted in political design."

"Thus, modern and contemporary art allows us to look at the historical period in which we live from the perspective of its end. "

I like this paragraph:
"How does the philosopher turn his gaze from the future to the past and adopt a reflective, truly philosophical attitude towards the world? In older times, the answer was given by religion: God (or gods) were believed to open to the human spirit the possibility of leaving the physical world—and looking back on it from a metaphysical position. Later, the opportunity for metanoia was offered by Hegelian philosophy: one could look back if one happened to be present at the end of history—at the moment when the further progress of the human Spirit became impossible. In our postmetaphysical age, the answer has been formulated mostly in vitalistic terms: one turns back if one reaches the limits of one’s own strength (Nietzsche), if one’s desire is repressed (Freud), or if one experiences the fear of death or the extreme boredom of existence (Heidegger)."

"Today, the philosopher does not need any subjective turning point, any real event, any meeting with death or with something or somebody radically other. After the French Revolution, art developed techniques for defunctionalizing the status quo that were aptly described by the Russian Formalists as “reduction,” the “zero device,” and “defamiliarization.” In our time, the philosopher has only to take a look at modern art, and he or she will know what to do. And this is precisely what Benjamin did. Art teaches us how to practice metanoia, a U-turn on the road towards the future, on the road of progress."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus_Novus

"It is this artistic, social, and political alpinism—in its bourgeois and Socialist forms—from which modern and contemporary art tries to save us. Modern art is made against the natural gift. It does not develop “human potential” but annuls it. It operates not by expansion but by reduction. Indeed, a genuine political transformation cannot be achieved according to the same logic of talent, effort, and competition on which the current market economy is based, but only by metanoia and kenosis—by a U-turn against the movement of progress, a U-turn against the pressure of upward mobility. "

This is the thesis: "One can aestheticize the world—and at the same time act within it. In fact, total aestheticization does not block political action; it enhances it. "

### Other random thoughts about "well designed" things
* Aspirational aesthetics that are a part of the world I live in include the world of technology toys we live amongst (but that eat our attention); startup and venture capital culture that create a lifestyle out of sleeping under a desk in order to "crush it" (while making money for other people). 

* Perhaps looking at what are the shiniest and most-promoted areas of our lives can give a feel as to what is being designed.
