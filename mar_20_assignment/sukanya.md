Better late than never…

I think Boris aestheticized his point… he defunctionalized his arguement by decorating it with academic jargon.

He makes sweeping statements, and forgets to articulate his definition of art - which seems rather narrow. 

I am bored of his west-centric view, and his disregard to acknowledge it. 

I would urge Boris to expand his world view, and consider conveying his simple ideas through simpler language, and using some illustrative examples to make his writing more engaging. 

On art activism, of course it can and has existed, I do not share the same criticism as the “art critics” Boris refers to. The intention and reception can at times be very disconnected, and criticism might reveal more about the viewer sometimes. Where there is this disconnect though, better communication would help, if the intention is to ‘activate’.
