My attention was caught first by the idea of art activism trying to reclaim art from the definition of being "useless." I would go further to say that art was never "useless," because it has always served as an investment vehicle. Art activism, from my perspective, attempts to turn art away from the capitalist intent of its industry. I do not understand Groys' claim that "many critics say that the morally good intentions of art activism substitute for artistic quality." He does not cite what critics these are. Much of this writing seems to be intentionally dense to me and based upon layers and layers of analysis by art critics before him.

I wasn't sure what Groys is trying to say when he talks about "aesthetics as revolution" - is he claiming that it ties in closely with propaganda and the attempt to make a political movement attractive, or is he talking about aestheticization reducing a thing from a previous time useless?

Art activism has a grain of hope to it. I tend to see art activism as _both_ a critique of the present time ("acceptance of one's own failure") and an attempt to subvert it.
