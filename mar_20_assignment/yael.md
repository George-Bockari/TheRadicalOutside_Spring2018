## Questions jotted down while reading On Art Activism

## Aestheticization of politics vs politicizing art 
Is there a space for both? Does one impede the other or do they overlap? Are designers merely complying since a user and their needs define the end product (even though grounded in form, function and meaning) no matter how creative the process? Does design always improve the status quo? How often is design just adding too much to an existing reality, far from actually improving it?
We can endlessly reproduce our voices via social media. When or how do we define the point of saturation? Does accessibility define the suitable moment, space or medium for action? Is accessibility related more to the creator or to their audience?

What is the role of subjective work in the space between aestheticization of politics vs politicizing art?

## The Work of Art In the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin:
*…Fascism attempts to organize the newly created proletarian masses without affecting the property structure which the masses strive to eliminate. Fascism sees its salvation in giving these masses not their right, but instead a chance to express themselves…  The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life…*

At one point or another, aren’t we all considered part of the masses?

## Metanoia
Were we looking into the 2050 future (last week) only to now turn our own gaze back and reflect? If today’s philosopher does not need a subjective turning point or real event, isn’t he ‘just’ a designer aiming to improve reality?

## Kenotic. Downward. Backward.
What determines ‘dysfunctional’ from ‘functional’? Are we defining a new space where the dysfunctional becomes the new functional? What role does representation play in this transition?

## Bottom line: as long as a revolutionary purpose grounds one’s action, aestheticization is valid
Is revolutionary purpose quantified?
