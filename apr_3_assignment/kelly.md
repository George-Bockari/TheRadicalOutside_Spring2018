* Critical Interface Manifesto
* Agile Manifesto
* Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace

I chose these manifestos not expecting them to complement each other, but thought their differences and similarities were interesting.
My main takeaway from the Critical Interface Manifesto was a largely good one, having already been a fan of Galloway's Interface Effect. Their general interpretation of a manifesto is "a political declaration of intentions or views". This is somewhat how I tend to view the idea of a "manifesto."

This is one reason why I'm a bit amused by the Agile Manifesto. I guess it is sort of political in that it deals with business and office "politics." Is it "fighting a lack of ethics" like the interface manifesto? To mee it seems like more of a list of guidelines on how to behave, as a much tamer corporate strategy than its overtly political counterparts.

The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace is more of a caricature of a manifesto. I found it to be obnoxiously utopian cyberpunk fiction. It's very dated considering how people on the internet interact today.
