* Critical Interface Manifesto
* Agile Manifesto
* Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace

I chose these manifestos not expecting them to complement each other, but thought their differences and similarities were interesting.
My main takeaway from the Critical Interface Manifesto was a largely good one, having already been a fan of Galloway's Interface Effect and unquestionably agreeing with everything they're arguing for. Their general interpretation of a manifesto is "a political declaration of intentions or views", which is somewhat how I tend to view a manifesto as well. The bullet points listed in the draft seem to assert themselves as facts, in an easily digestible manner. I guess maybe that's what a manifesto is- making assertions about the way things are and a stance on what needs to be changed? 

I'm a bit amused by the Agile Manifesto. I guess it is sort of political in that it deals with business and office "politics." Is it "fighting a lack of ethics" like the interface manifesto? To mee it seems like more of a list of guidelines on how to behave, as a much tamer corporate strategy than its overtly political counterparts.

The Declaration of Independence of Cyberspace is more of a caricature of a manifesto. I found it to sound like obnoxiously utopian cyberpunk fiction. It's very dated considering how people on the internet behave today. I think the intention is cute, sure, but also unsettlingly libertarian and brings to mind a Silicon Valley kid on LSD. The whole claim to unlimited free speech echoes the disingenuous trolls of 4chan. It's naive to state that the Golden Rule is the one law that everyone in cyberspace will unconditionally abide by. All this aside, I think the argument for an internet unregulated by governments or monopolies is a valid one, but this author is not coming from a place that I feel comfortable entirely aligning with.
