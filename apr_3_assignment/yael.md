## The Lo-Fi Manifesto, Karl Stolley (2008)
Non-hierarchal use of tools and content are expressed as essential factors to adopting a nimble mindset of production. Comparing ‘production’ and ‘making’, with the latter (re)introduced over the past few years through makers subculture, both focus on sharing ideas, tools and emphasizing collaboration around creation and distribution. The concept of elevating ease over expertise seems somewhat ambiguous due to varied learning curves (barely mentioned in this piece) although shared usage, research and act of production, activates support systems and diversifies roles, enabling users to navigate between opportunities to participate as audience or contributor based on interest or skill level.

## Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st Century, VNS Matrix (1991)
The non-linear multi-layered and uber synthesized nature of this manifesto redefines what a manifesto could be. While the initial intention declared
as “multiple media that gave vivid expression to the emerging political position of cyberfeminism… opportunity to disrupt society’s patriarchal norms, and to have fun doing it” is present throughout, getting lost in content, scale and authorship becomes a playground for interpretation. There’s no right or wrong and all are welcome. Clicking through this piece I barely expected to have a clear understanding of the topic via preaching statements. The fluidity of content and notion of parallel narratives when it comes to time (and navigation), supports endless, open-ended interpretations and representations across mediums. LOVED IT!


## Computer Lib, Theodor Nelson (1974) 
Inclusion and demystification of computers, where everyone can participate (non-hierarchal control or contribution of content), support or oppose. The manifesto could suggest, or act as, a template to other nowadays topics.
  Example: *Any nitwit can understand ~~computers~~ (replace with any other centralized domain) and many do. Unfortunately, due to ridiculous historical circumstances, ~~computers~~ (replace with any other centralized domain) have been made a mystery to most of the world….*

  *…Any bright highschool kid, or anyone else who can stumble through the details of a ~~photography magazine~~ (Wikipedia, webMD, Psychology Today, TED?) should be able to understand this book (topic), or get the main ideas. This will not make you a ~~programmer~~ (replace with expert practitioner) or a ~~computer person~~ (replace with enthusiastic user), though it may help you talk that talk, and perhaps make you feel more comfortable (or at least able to cope) when new ~~machines~~ (replace with devices or ideas?) encroach on your life.*

Reading these manifestos serves an additional layer to frame and align my current SFPC experience while thinking about the post-SFPC future. What might be my / our post-SFPC manifesto?
