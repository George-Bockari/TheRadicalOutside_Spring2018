This response is primarily to "Xenofeminism" as it left the strongest impression on me of the manifestos I chose to read. (The others: the mundane Afrofuturist manifesto, the critical engineering manifesto, and the guerilla open access manifesto.)

"Alienation is the labor of freedom's construction" is a quote that stayed with me; perhaps a more powerful statement of the old saying about changing things you can't accept rather than accepting things you can't change.
I don't actually agree alienation is labor in itself, but it may often be the first step to doing necessary work, as your alienation is the indication that that work needs doing.
I also liked the emphasis throughout the text on anti-essentialism, all the way through the conclusion.
Another statement that resonated with me was "Without the labour of large-scale, collective social organisation, declaring one's desire for global change is nothing more than wishful thinking."
This is a fact!

However, I wish the text contained more clues as to how to go about this organizing.
The discussion of the importance of the built environment and "domestic" space for women and queers was helpful, though brief.
But though I also see the need for it, I have little concrete idea how to go about "engineer[ing] an economy that liberates reproductive labour and family life, while building models of familiality free from the deadening grind of wage labour".

I was also confused by the langauge in many cases.
I had no idea what was meant by "We want superior forms of corruption", which came in the context of some analysis of the negative role of heavily visual social media compared to the liberating promises of text-based cyberspace.
Nor did I ever understand what was particularly "xeno" about this feminism, nor what was meant by "mesopolitical", or numerous other terms throughout.
Overall, I think the lack of accessibility of the text will necessarily limit its reach.
Still though, even if I understood less than half of the manifesto and am unsure what it will actually mean for my concrete behavior, the reflections I've had about alienation thanks to it were worth the investment of time.
I will probably return and try again to understand more of what was meant.
