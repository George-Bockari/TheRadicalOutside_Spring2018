Response to Guerilla Open Access Manifesto, The Zero Dollar Laptop Manifesto, The Critical Engineering Manifesto and
The Slow Media Manifesto, We Lost etc...

I'm not exactly sure what I'm trying to say here, something along the vein of we keep expecting tech to save us
but it can only reflect us. I haven't fully collected all my thoughts so they will be a bit scattered. 

The 'We Lost' manifesto starts out by saying "We lost. We, who believed the Internet could change society, that 
technology could take other paths than surveillance, centralization and consumerism." I guess I'm wondering and 
thinking about how as a society there's so much wrong but we expect that not to be reflected in everything we make. 
Is it so unbelievable that the internet took the path of surveillance and capitalism when that's what a lot of society 
is built on? The internet was supposed to be a tool for democratization, to empower, inform and liberate. Something open,
decentralised but instead we got what we have now -- power in the hands of the few and existing inequalities reflected.
Same with how bitcoin was supposed to be decentralized currency. Maybe there's a reason we can't get it right the first 
time around -- maybe the tools we build reflect the society we are and tech can't be the solution, can only be an
extension of a current reality. 

The Open Access Movement fights to ensure that the work of scientists  "is published on the Internet, under terms
that allow anyone to access it." The internet is seen as again this equalizing factor even though [40 percent of Detroit
residents don't have any access to internet at all](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/kz3xyz/detroit-mesh-network) 
and internet speeds, access to devices one can use to access the internet vary widely across the country and the world.
Additionally, where do you put this information where anyone can access it? [Google Drive?](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error
) Corporations like Google and thus their products espouse many of society's beliefs about what's "appropriate" and "acceptable" 
(sex work is not) so they aren't sufficient candidates for open access. Similarily, "sharing" is called "stealing or piracy" 
because we're in a capitalist system. The Zero Dollar Laptop Manifesto also has a 'tech can fix it all' vibe. Although later in the comments they clarify that 
"it's not about laptops - it's about education," they are looking to laptops as a sure way to increase access to education. 
They push for the 'One Child, one laptop" although it is very clearly for many reasons not going to be the solution to the 
education problem in developing countries (no teacher training, electricity is a problem in many developing areas, not every 
child learns through self-teaching). 

With the The Critical Engineering Manifesto, I was looking for something that mentioned
how the work of engineering is always influenced by the people who make it and thus by existing issues and 
inequalities. It mentioned engineering's relationship to the user and that "written code expands into social and 
psychological realms" but not that written code is _influenced_ by existing social, psychological systems. I feel like 
it treats engineering as something that yes, has a lot of potential to be bad but that inherently doesn't sway in any 
direction. Whereas maybe the internet and products are bad because we are...
