This as a manifesto for technologists and designers of all trades. It gives guidence on their actions and purpose.

We live in a technologically developed world that is highly designed. Everything we touch, watch, consume is based on explicit human design. The fields of science and technology that design our workd start out monolithic, with just a few deep ideas. Previouse generations could master all those ideas. But as time passes that monolithic character changes. We discover many deep new ideas, too many for any one person to really master. As a result, the social structure of the world re-organizes and divides around those ideas. Instead of a monolith, we have ideas within ideas within ideas, a complex, recursive, self-referential scientific structure, whose organization mirrors the connections between our deepest insights. And so the structure of our technology shapes the social organization of the world it is inhabiting. But that social shape in turn constrains and helps determine what we can discover. This fact is often interpreted as a sign that we have reached a state after the end of history, or a state of total exhaustion that makes any further historical action impossible. The layers of technological transformations are not accessible to the public and there is a structure of privilege around it. The lag of access will lead to spiritual, intellectual and economic decline.

The layers of transformations that our services are based on obfuscate us. Each transformation has a resolution to which humans are mostly blind to. There is a covert, nepotist cartel of protocols that governs the flows and resolutions of data and information just for the sake of functionality and efficiency. The sole aim of this cartel is to uphold the dogma of modern computation, which is about making actors function together (resonate) as efficiently as possible, tweaking out resources to maximum capacity, without bottlenecks. The efficiency and functionality of those transformations are shaping our objects and also us. The we-lost manifesto is stating “We don't need robots, we are robots”. [The Man drives car onto walkway after being instructed by his Uber app](https://twitter.com/i/moments/978449344587235328) confirms that. There is a need to acknowledge and explore those transformations and their resolutions. There is no technological innovation that has not an aggressive character. Work based on love and care has to dis obfuscated technology. The caring technologist makes technology accessible and simple to allow humans to have a more healthy relationship with it.

The caring technologist refuses to stay locked into one medium and is interdisciplinarity. The manifesto on glitch research states "Flow cannot be understood without interruption or function without glitching". This manifesto for the caring technologist is not limitted to glitches of digital computation but embraces all designed transformations such as interplay of physical quantities in electro-mechanic systems, sensoric, actoric, human perception, vision, protocols and computation.

Steps to verify caring technology:
1) It is documented and illustrated in a way it could be reproduced by its client to maximize transparrency. Transparant technology can be identified by its diy kit shipped with the product. 
2) Every newly introduced transformation layer (protocols, encoding techniques, programming languages, ..) has to remove at least two existing ones.
3) The resoultion (technical, social, ethical) of a technology needs to be outlined to its audience as part of an end user resolution agreement.

While we have been anxiously looking forward to the point when machines will be smarter than humans, actual singularity is when the human figure becomes a homogenous agents in a totally designed world. It is now the obligation of the caring technologists to take action. It is here that you have to do things that when you are gone dont leave behind.
