This as a manifesto for technologists of all trades. It gives guidance on their actions and purpose.

We live in a world that is highly engineered. Everything we touch, watch, consume is based on explicit design. The fields of science and technology that design our world start out monolithic, with just a few deep ideas. Previous generations could master all those ideas. But as time passes that monolithic character changes. We discover many deep new ideas, too many for any one person to really master. As a result, the social structure of humankind re-organizes and divides around those ideas. Instead of a monolith, we have ideas within ideas within ideas, a complex, recursive, self-referential scientific structure, whose organization mirrors the connections between our deepest insights. And so the structure of our technology shapes the social organization of the world it is inhabiting. But that social shape in turn constrains and helps determine what we can discover. This fact is often interpreted as a sign that we have reached a state after the end of history, or a state of total exhaustion that makes any further historical action impossible. The layers of technological transformations are not accessible to the public and there is a structure of privilege around it. The lag of access will lead to spiritual, intellectual and economic decline.

The layers of engineered transformations that our services are based on obfuscate us. Each transformation has a resolution to which humans are mostly blind to. There is a covert, nepotist cartel of protocols that governs the flows and resolutions of data and information just for the sake of functionality and efficiency. The sole aim of this cartel is to uphold the dogma of modern computation, which is about making actors function together (resonate) as efficiently as possible, tweaking out resources to maximum capacity, without bottlenecks. The efficiency and functionality of those transformations are shaping our objects and also us. The we-lost manifesto is stating “We don't need robots, we are robots”. [The Man drives car onto walkway after being instructed by his Uber app](https://twitter.com/i/moments/978449344587235328) confirms that. There is a need to acknowledge and explore those transformations and their resolutions. There is no technological innovation that has not an aggressive character. Work based on love and care has to dis obfuscate technology. The caring technologist makes technology accessible and simple to allow humans to have a more healthy relationship with it.

The caring technologist refuses to stay locked into one medium and is interdisciplinarity. The manifesto on glitch research explores functioning of computational objects in irregular ways. It states "Flow cannot be understood without interruption or function without glitching". This manifesto for the caring technologist is not limitted to exploring and resolving glitches of digital computation but embraces glitches on all designed transformations such as the interplay of physical quantities in electro-mechanic systems, sensoric, actoric, human perception, vision, protocols and computation.

Steps to verify caring technology:
1) It is documented and illustrated in a way it could be reproduced by its client. Transparant technology can be identified by its diy kit shipped with the product. 
2) Caring technology introducing newly engineered transformation layers (protocols, encoding techniques, programming languages, ..) removes two existing ones.
3) Resoultions and glitches (technical, social, ethical) of caring technology are outlined to its audience as part of an end user experience agreement.

While humankind has been anxiously looking forward to the point when machines become smarter than humans, actual singularity is when the human figure becomes a homogenous agent in a totally designed world and humans become slaves to their machines. It is now the obligation of the caring technologists to take action to save humankind. 

It is here that you have to do things that when you are gone dont leave behind.
