# The Hows and Whys 

Through the three manifestos I chose, I noticed the commonly prominent theme of asserting humanity in places that humanity isn't thought to be seen. Although very different, the three seem to have this underlying objective to dismantle authority, whether in the form of an oppressive economic system, a stale cultural ideology, or a prevailing trend. Perhaps this is a common theme among manifestos of all types. 

One thing about these manifestos, though, is that they read as unique combination of fluffy and dense, logical and idealogical â€” almost as if some cross breed of lawyerly poetry. They bring me this weird uneasiness, evoking images of never ending cycles of tyranny and revolution. How does one productively navigate the inspirational and powerful yet speculative and dogmatic nature of manifestos? 

That's probably the point of this exercise, maybe even the essence of my experience this course. But maybe, at its root, this navigation isn't overly complex (though definitely not easy). Because manifestos, like art and any act of creating, are a sort of assertion of identity, a proclamation of worth by a single individual. 

Maybe the 'trick' then is to be always cognizant of when and where someone else's assertion hinders your own. Sometimes it's just hard to tell if or when someone else is doing your thinking for you.
