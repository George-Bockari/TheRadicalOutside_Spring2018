I like the singularity of the "manifesto genre". It seems put in place to bring the full force of your intention to one idea, laying down laws and not equivocating. Taking up space in the world and asserting your shape onto it, explicitly looking at the existing patterns of the world and then laying a big yellow line down the middle of them. 

I've never been exposed to any manifestos in any of my schooling. I could see this genre being a threatening one to expose young people to (from the perspective of the education system). 

It's an interesting writing style, very oppositional. They feel adolescent in that spirit: black & white. There's a flatness in the writing style & presentation that's like a war with a straw man: you see what the authors are fighting against as well as for.

I especially liked the Iterative Book Development one b/c it was four lines long. So I've responded with a four line of my own, 

## Manifesto for comfort and frivolity

* Eat snow when it is fresh
* Eat chocolate for breakfast dessert
* Start the night sleeping in socks
* Nap face down in the afternoon
