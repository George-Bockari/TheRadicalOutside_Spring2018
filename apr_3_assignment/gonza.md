Reading theses manifestos I see that the duality of ownership - knowledge is great concern. The amount of unnecessary things we know, such as logos, brand colors, jingles and slogans is overwhelming. The same goes with the different applications and protocols necessary to work and produce. We didn't ask for these things to be in our thoughts and memories. It's fascinating, and also scary, how people who grew in distant cultures subjected to the same movies and tv shows.

It's important to enforce ownership over our objects, and not to submit to the way IT wants to run. We, as developers have the obligation to create open architectures, hackable structures and benign technology.
