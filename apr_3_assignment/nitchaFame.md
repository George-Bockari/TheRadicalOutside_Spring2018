# On Manifestos
Responses and thought on the Manifestos:
[Lowtech Manifesto](https://github.com/greyscalepress/manifestos/blob/master/content/manifestos/1999-LowTech-manifesto.md)
The main idea of the manifesto is accessible. The core idea of it opposes the usual technology trend "cheap and free," " simple and non-exclusive," "independent" while bringing up the benefit of that.   

[Slow Media Manifesto](https://github.com/greyscalepress/manifestos/blob/master/content/manifestos/2010-01-02-Slow-Media-Manifesto.txt)
The manifesto overall is enjoyable, but I'm not convinced on every aspect of it. The part that I'm fascinated with is
"2. Slow media promote Monotasking. Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but provoke the full concentration of their users."
The writers aware of the media making and be mindful in many level and also reflect in there action as they describe. However, some of the claims are so limited in small circle of media making industry versus it could cover all other area of makers.

[Glitch Studies Manifesto](https://github.com/greyscalepress/manifestos/blob/master/content/manifestos/2009-glitch-studies.md)
The manifesto point to the norm-systems to emphasize how the glitch, as an error mistake in the system can be an alternative escape from the mainstream culture of making and become crucial to understand. It also interesting that the writer also concerns, as the aesthetic of glitch is unique, the writer even aware of the look became a trend and losing the original purpose. The attractive part is the perspective of trying to understand the thing that considers false and mistake.
