## [the cybertwee manifesto (2014)](http://cybertwee.net/)

The cybertwee manifesto is cute. I remember coming across it a few years ago; it's probably informed some of my work since then. It's difficult to see it in the same light today; the past few years brought us a cuter / more pastel internet than I could have imagined. It's harder now to separate the good intentions of this manifesto from the commercialized aesthetic that came with it. Self-care as an industry, manufactured nostalgia, [vapor]wave cassette tapes. But that's not in the spirit of "our nectar is not just a lure / or a trap for passing flies", so I guess this manifesto still gets a pass :)

## [Manifesto for Maintenance Art (1969)](https://www.arnolfini.org.uk/blog/manifesto-for-maintenance-art-1969/Ukeles_MANIFESTO.pdf)

I return to this manifesto frequently. I love the distinction between the Death Instinct (Silicon Valley) and the Life Instinct (The Maintainersâ€¦?). I grapple with how this system envisions systemic change. Placing equal importance on maintenance vs. "disruption" would surely require a huge societal shift anyway, but: "Maintenance systems are direct feedback systems with little room for alteration." So are we just maintaining the same racist, broken systems that we've already got? Testing military equipment, fixing jails, and re-paving highways are all forms of maintenance.

I like this from a personal / ecological / feminist / worker perspective, which is all I can really ask. I don't think Ukeles was trying to call maintenance a fix-all.

## [Manifesto for the Unstable Media (1987)](https://github.com/greyscalepress/manifestos/blob/master/content/manifestos/1987-unstable-media.md)

I found this to be the least specific manifesto of the three. Perhaps because it's about electronic media? Perhaps because it's translated from Dutch? Anyway, I didn't get much out of it apart from really digging the term "Unstable Media". Also total nitpick but: I'm disappointed that a manifesto which "strives for constant change" hasn't changed since its initial publication despite V2_ remaining active.
