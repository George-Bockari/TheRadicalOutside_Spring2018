Manifest on user versus technology interaction

# Our configuration 
This manifesto is written for native technology users. It gives guidance gaiidens on an userâ€™s role when using technology. Living in a world of technology should not give the impression to an user of living in a digital world. A technology user needs to understand that all experiences trigger analog actions. It is crucial for a technology user to understand the analog action can be triggered but is not requiring digital experience.

Digital triggers:
- Monitors.  - eye
- Keyboards  - hand
- Mouse. - hand
- Tablet 
- Controllers
- Sound notifications
- Smart watches
- Home assistants
- Phones
- Robots - labor

# Our obligation
Do we need analog action to understand the digital world? Or do we need a digital world for analog action? Is digital experience triggering analog experience or is the analog world trigger digital experience?  How does the technology control us and form our habits and expectations and how do we apply it to the analog world. When the technology exerts a force on users, the users simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the technology. Users and technology form a communication system. Just as technology enforces its agenda on users, users enforce their agenda on technology. Both sides enslave each other. It is the users call to enforce its expectations to keep this interplay in balance. Do not let google do it.
