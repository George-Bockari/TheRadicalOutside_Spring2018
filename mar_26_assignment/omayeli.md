# Above Ground

I'm waiting for my sister to get back. I'm not sure where she went -- mom didn't ask either
but she was supposed to be back 10 minutes ago so I could go out and get supplies while the 
sun is still up. I wait 5 more minutes. Look at my watch. I'm about to go over to the other room
and complain to my mother when she bursts through the door. She looks at me pleadingly and throws 
the resisters over. I wear my shoes and hover my feet over them. They glue on. I walk outside and 
take a look down. I never get used to it. Our house is 30 feet above ground, anchored by 6in wide 
metal columns going all the way down to the ocean floor. We've been above ground for 3 years now. 
After Flood Pence when we realized no one was coming to get us, we started drawing up plans for 
houses above water. I jump off our stoop and start walking towards the store. It's frustrating 
having just one pair of resistors for the whole family but we can't get another one for a few months.
Hopean, which makes them, goes through cycles of production and teaching. Right now they are running 
workshops so others learn how to make them. After 4 months, they'll go into a round of production with
the new recruits. On one side of the resistor is a magnet, the soles of our shoes are laced with iron 
so they can come on. On the other end of the resistor is a mutated plant in soil. Certain plants were 
given steriods to increase the gravity resistant capabilities in their cell walls. The resistors allow 
us to walk on air until the plant dies (which it does every couple of hours). The greenhouse where we 
get supplies is about 3 miles away where there is still land above ocean level. I say hello to my 
neighbor, they put 10 fingers up to remind me they want 10 tomatoes. I give them a thumbs up and head
towards the greenhouse.
