I adjust my costume, it's about time to perform for the Handernar family. It's been three months since November 2nd, 2040; since I started performing. This is the fourth family's circus I've been a part of. New acts are added every day as new people filter in; I usually stay on a compound for 8 days to a couple of weeks or until the families request fresh content. 

As I get ready, I catch a glimpse of a headline as they flash on the mirrors, "Governor Neeju's 'Clean the Streets' Program a Smashing Success!" This is the thing the governor has been pushing this whole time - the one thing she promised the citizens of Narwahal - finally a city you deserve, free of the mounds of bodies piling up day after day on the streets! And how lucky for the homeless! To be safe from the changing tides of Weather, harsh in heat and frost switching off what feels like day by day. 

In one fell swoop, the streets were emptied that day. Each homeless person was assigned to their first family compound - where they would become resident performers. Now that each family had so much leisure time, they didn't know what to do with themselves! FactorBots have been trained as factory workers, miners, gynecologists, lawyers, you name it. But they were shit at theater. 

And that's where we come in. As we lost our jobs, one by one, we fought for survival. We had to react to weather patterns, search for food, the drama of it all! Yes, our instincts were being primed for entertainment this entire time.

Once a radio engineer, I made friends with Siriola, who I noticed was playing with older electronics he had found. A curious child, Siriola had taken them all apart, but didn't know how to piece them back together. The Secretary of Education had long eliminated compulsory education, and given the status of Siriola's parents, he didn't really need to know all that much beyond holding the key to the FactorBot algorithms. Never having had a teacher before, Siriola began to gift me parts of radios he didn't think he wanted. 

When you receive a gift, you must give to others. This is what I told Siriola as I began to request more radios to gift to the other performers. It is time to create our own network, beyond the family compounds.
