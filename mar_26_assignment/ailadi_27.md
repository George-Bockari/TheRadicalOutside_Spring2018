Climate change /tropical weather /flooding /... set the condition for the formation of insalubrious areas, incubators of a new generation of bacteria, grown feeding on OMG plants that resist high temperature and the up to know researched medical drugs and vaccines. When contracted by drinking unsalubrious water, they colonize the lower abdomen and are hardly symptomatic in the host body.

Their detection is difficult as cyst can be observed only during the duplication process happening every two weeks in the examination of stool over an incubation period of 3 day. The identification is further complicated by their morphology and most people can’t afford the cost of laboratory exams. 

The parasite causes sterility in man that contracted it.

People living in the floating housing are highly more likely to get it, while people affording to live in the suspended areas are rarely contracting the bacteria as they have access to purified water and eat synthetic vegetables.

Protestors say the origin of the bacteria are to be found in experiment and strategic research to limit overpopulation in a planet that can’t sustain anymore 9 billion people with the redefinition of the territory by the rising of the seas and the voracious reduction of fertilized ground due to pollution infiltrations.

Independent researches discovered that the semen is still fertile but ‘dies’ in the way out and if collected directly from the testicles could be used for procreation. At the center of the discussion is a DIY kit with a minimal cost, that of a syringe and a few illustrations and instructions on how to perform the operation along with the information regarding the bacteria and its effects.
