It's already 8:30am and you notice you slept through your alarm. You climb out of bed and skip half your morning routine to get to the train on time. On your way out of your condo you grab the trash receptacle and drop it into the trash tube.
It is a merciful 80 degrees outside. People are out walking their dogs underneath the sidewalk awnings and children play in the municipal fountains. Normally during hotter days, most would stay inside, in the dark, for their own safety.

Your mind briefly wanders to the time when air conditioning was a staple of society. Dealing with the excruciating heat is still difficult sometimes, but ever since the Climate Tolerance Initiative was established, the detrimental AC was replaced with mandatory training sessions for emotional and physical distress tolerance, starting from early age. People nowadays have remarkable endurance capabilities.

It turns out you arrive at work a little earlier than expected. You work in a bright and cozy yet spacious warehouse, meticulously up to code with ample plant life.

Your coworkers are laughing and chatting as the day begins. You find your way to your desk to begin sorting out your tasks for the day. You work for the city, as does everyone else. Your job revolves around arranging collaborations for new city features primarily focused on community defense from climate. You are tasked with recruiting people with the skills and enthusiasm to make things happen. You start by composing a few emails and drafting up a proposal.

You absent mindedly place your fingers on your earpiece. It's a brainwave sensor salvaged from electronic waste and restored by local engineers. In accordance to the Analog Information Protocol established in 2035, the device is not connected to any network - the log of your brainwave activity is stored on a card, to be transferred to a printer. Then you can print out a chart about what it perceives to be how you are doing and feeling, like an emotional FitBit.

The next well being meeting is on Thursday, and you hope you won't feel the need to do too much self censoring before you hand in your sheet, even though it is not explicitly discouraged. Nowadays people freely volunteer their information due to their trust in the analog printing process, and their trust in other people here on Earth. Everyone is doing the best they can here in the face of the increasingly hostile climate, and fortunately this week has not been the worst week in the world for you.

Your colleague and friend approaches your desk. You've been taking a break from work anyway to sneak a peek at what the mainstream internet is up to, against the recommendations of your support group.
"Check out this VR card I bought on Mars," your friend says gleefully. You remember she had to travel all the way to Mars to renew her interplanetary ID. You have only been to the colony once, but prefer not to go - it's too sterile and confining, full of technocrats and restricted areas, and you're irritated with the condescending pity you get from people when they find out where you are from.
Your friend slides the tiny card into a slot into a VR device, then places the device on your face.

As the scene comes into view, you immediately recognize that it's set in your own neighborhood, except it's during the aftermath of a recent hurricane. Debris floats everywhere, and the neighborhood folks have brought out their canoes and begun salvaging what they can, all over again.
It's clear that the creators of this experience didn't care to note the disaster response brigades that do a tremendous job of cleaning up the mess, every single time, because practice makes perfect. You scoff, roll your eyes, hand the device back.

"Is this really all they see in Earth?" your friend speculates, snickering. The answer seems to be yes - it's how they prefer to see it. They may have left Earth to die, but from your perspective, there's still some life left in it yet.
