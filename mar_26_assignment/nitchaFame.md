#On Other Futurisms
Today I’m going to cross the border. I might take me about a week to get back home. The aquatic plants near our area do not grow fast enough for my family. The border protection is very loose down here. Most of the people move to the sky. They only care if the floating ship cross-border, not down here. I put up my shamanic suit. “Don’t stay down there too long, your skin not pretty” My mom always worry and yell like this, I count it as a lucky sign “I know mom, no need to say it! I’m going, See you in a week.”
I left the penthouse, the abandon penthouse that turns to be our home that the water still a couple meter away. It’s funny that rich people always live on top of our head. At least, what I like about the flood is it divide us because now I can go as deep as I can. I stop by at shaman’s place who live underwater. He’s the one who helps hack people body in this area. He gives me a device to attach to my sacred prothetic lower face part to enhance the time I can spend down there and add spiritual power.
