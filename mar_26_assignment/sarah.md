Some product ideas for displaced communities, keeping in mind that I don't know how to solve for which communities are displaced and if nothing changes, it will be the same communities as it is now, hence this document doesn't solve any problems, and leaves me feeling bleak. We'd have to do social engineering to do things like have countries voluntarily dissolve borders and concepts of nationalism and exclusion. I don't know how to have humans not be human, which involves as history shows, colonizing, othering, and hoarding. Hence, all of my ideas feel like whimsical footnotes on a story that won't support them, and as such are problematic. Apologies for what reads like a somewhat sulky introduction.

If [the rich build bunkers underground](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich) we can invent a water-diverting device that re-appropriates the water allocated for their jacuzzis.

Solar tenting. Temporary living structures than can be broken down and carried but that harness solar-power so that they can be heated and generate electricity. 

Furthering the idea of composable housing, a "Movable City". Modeled on how nomads travel, a movable city can be made of many lightweight composable parts that can be assembled together to house large communities of people and their pets and provide for short-term needs, including living, sleeping, water de-salination, air purification, community gathering, seed-farming, food preservation, subsistence hunting, etc.  This idea makes an architectural nod to [Michael Rakowitz' paraSITE piece](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/94026) but has a different intent: not to conceptualize and highlight disaster victims, but to use lightweight composable materials to build structures that can support different forms of nomadic living in a way that supports the inhabitants.  

Border-dissolution devices. 

Signal-scramblers for groups being hunted by militia.
