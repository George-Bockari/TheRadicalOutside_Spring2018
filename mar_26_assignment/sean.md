Something is wrong. No one stays up this late. No one has complicated thoughts keeping them awake anymore, because it's all been simplified. They know exactly who they are, where they are - the answers are in their standard issue biological test; all questions put to rest with simple and direct formulas, alleviating all possibility of stress. They know which hairstyle is optimal for their face shape, which romantic prospect will bring them the most quantifiable joy, the exact time, date, and cause of their death, and which interplanetary vacation is best for their personality, etc. Virtually every possible human question has been answered by the State's AI powered genetic assessment, uniting the western world under one single ideology.  

But there was an issue with my mandatory annual re-test. A momentary power outage, or something. And now I can't sleep. It's been 40 hours since I last slept. But I just can't. Something feels wrong, but what could possibly be the issue? I know exactly how to quantify and create happiness. I know everything I need to know. It's all right there in the State's Genetic Existentialism documentation.

Right? 

I can't grasp what's wrong, but the word on my constantly forming in my mouth is 'why'. Why should I know the exact date of my death? Why is there still suffering in other countries if we know how to quantify and create happiness? Why does everyone listen to the same music? Where does the State take people with 'genetic glitches? If my mandatory re-test was messed up, why do I suddenly feel so *alive*?

The thought from the reading that catastrophe can be quite compatible with normality really stood out to me and made me think that most realistic dystopia thing I can imagine is a future where we're all sort of sedated, content, while blissfully ignorant of larger issues. It speaks to me personally because I've noticed I make the biggest mistakes when I feel overly satisfied and knowledgable.
