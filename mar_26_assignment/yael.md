## Trade migrations
Every third Tuesday of the month, immigration services switched to the 1024-B process of balancing borders. For every person immigrating into the country, another was randomly selected to leave. The head of the department always hesitated before activating the algorithm. A couple years ago, his uncle had to pack at midnight and leave by dawn.



## Strike two
The union declared a strike, yet electricity will cease as of early next week.
Residents over 65 will be granted four hours of power on odd days of the week. Daily water supply will be available to all from 7am to 10am. Access to the beach will remain free of charge.
