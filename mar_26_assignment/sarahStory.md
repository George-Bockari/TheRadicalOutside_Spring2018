The first weapon in ww3 didn't come from the sky like a bomb, or even from the blood like a virus. It wasn't a sharp sound or a hot fire. 

Or so I'm told.  Some say there was a huge explosion.

The first weapon of ww3 was called "gaslighting". In other words, erasure. Started as a tool they used on the women, realized how much quicker if they spread it. 

It comes down to this: it's pretty hard for most folk to do something that doesn't sit well with others.  Banishments may seem small-fry: an eye-roll here, a chuckle there, but it's the first pass on the road to isolation and never in a million years does anyone actually want that (no matter how much they gripe about "hating others" and "just wanting to order a pizza and get away from the shit for a while").  

The mistake we made was not owning that. We loved our individuality but refused to ack that we change state, like water, depending on our who's around us. Alone sure, you're the hero, easy peasy. But when half your friends don't even agree the sky is blue, where do you start. 

Once we stopped conversing in physical public spaces and moved to virtual ones we were easy targets. 

Our colonizers were invisible at first: in the early 21st century our conversations were invaded by people who looked like us ("friends"), or people we saw as the enemy ("trolls"). Except they weren't really "people", at least as we'd understood till then: they were swarms of our own thoughts, injected into "responsive mobile interfaces", flashing and clicking like everyone else, the nicest shades of blue... 

Imagine a ghost in every one of your conversations, there enough to sway you, or rage  you, and then gone. 

Now they're not just "web forms". How primitive. Half "the people" I pass on the street? Figments of my own imagination or the imagination of my players: I honestly can't tell the difference anymore and that's how they keep me.  The street I see when I'm walking down it? Nothing like the one you may be seeing. We'd fight each other to the death over that, and we do, every third friday in the stadium outside "town".  

Belief is a funny thing, huh: you just want to keep your senses. What good are eyes if they just play old movies?  Having truth ripped from them? Well, some folks get crazy and others get quiet but they have us where they want us, hey, i'll buy one of those...

Sorry, I needed a coke.  

It's 3000. New Millenium. Welcome. Sidewalks are white, very few people are outside anymore. It's hot.   A lot of people died. Other people left. We do chores, raking the fields while we process, and so on.  

Our ASIC chips optimize our "wetware": our home-grown, skull-enclosed neural networks. We're able to mine cryptocurrencies and search for aliens with our brains. Ha ha. That last part is a joke. But maybe we are searching for aliens. I don't know. I know that I'm tired and that my thoughts run off in odd directions. Also, our brains are networked so it is easy for them to control us, to turn us against each other in some kinds of robot mobs. They do this on Friday.  I turned mine off. That's not true. Another joke? We turned Jared's off, that's the truth. That's why he's "like this": vacant, slow, dead-eyed. I miss him. I miss the light in his eyes. We had to cut cords in there and we did our best but, you know, I'm not a rocket scientist. Or so the old saying goes. Or maybe I am. Maybe I'm working on high-powered rocket science and I don't know it. They've routed our output so you never know what you're "working on", just that you need a lot of Gatorade and the sun seems to be moving slowly. 

We cut it because that was our only hope. We think that by decolonizing his brain, we'll be able to restore memories there.  It's slow going: the people on the other side of the fence are passing story strings: ropes knotted to encode the story of the wars, and the story of what came before. Jared can collect them and memorize them and unlike me he won't be "reset" in the morning. Or the evening. Or in the middle of a cycle. He'll be able to --
