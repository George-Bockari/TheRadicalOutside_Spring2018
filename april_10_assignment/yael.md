Thinking about the poor image, expanding the meaning assigned to content while blurring the definition of creator, curator and audience, in order to accept almost any new context for the visual, suggests a different view of archiving. With constant editing, distribution and circulation, the source of content barely matters. Content is focused around the current, temporary, circumstances which may quickly change upon the next edit.  

 Should nothing be taken for granted?  

Imperfections provide additional perspectives yet the idea of *“…compressed attention spans, on impression rather than immersion, on intensity rather than contemplation, on previews rather than screenings..”* should consider attention to meaning and context. Short lived value of content juxtaposed with excess of visuals can turn chaotic. In order to carry and spread a message aiming at impact disruptive movements (transient copies) still aim for a recognized voice (original aura). Re-appropriated narratives better offer content accessible to new audiences otherwise they risk being circulated mainly within the same society that creates them.
