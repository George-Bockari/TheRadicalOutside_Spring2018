When the market invested in cinema as a consumer product, providers of high quality monopolized the scene and independent production got marginalized and finally accessible only to an restricted group of people. Low resolution redistributed access to independent productions but then got again diluted in a sea of consumer images so only few people can scout quality content. Seems that independent production stays accessible to a niche regardless of the quality.
