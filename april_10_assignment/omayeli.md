What do we need to proceed?

In Black Quantum Futurism, Rasheedah Phillips mentions something Frederick Douglass said in 1854 - 
"America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnly binds herself to be false to the future."
It's clear access and awareness of the past is necessary to create a different future and not make the same 
mistakes. It's useful for understanding the present, for inspiration and as an example. I can think of many
other uses for the past and there are a couple that came up when I was watching the talk. My question is about 
what we do and don't need the past for. What do we need for the future?

Phillips mentioned the connection between religion and time. Religion (Christianity) was one of the ways colonizers 
and slave-owners used to exert control over African nations and slaves. "When the Missionaries arrived, the Africans had the Land and the Missionaries had the Bible. They taught us how to pray
with our eyes closed. When we opened them, they had the land and we had the Bible." - Jomo Kenyatta, reported in John Frederick
Walker, A Certain Curve of Horn: The Hundred-Year Quest for the Giant Sable Antelope of Angola (2004), p. 144; also attributed to Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

After colonization and slavery (or maybe the word after is not appropriate because as Phillips said, when did subgugation
and slavery _end_)  As a result of colonization and slavery, indigenous religions became outlawed and demonized. Now, 
after acknowledging that "Jesus Hasn't Saved Us" and that a lot of the dominant religious practices (i.e christianity)
have roots in colonization and slavery, members of the diaspora are [returning to ancestral religions](https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/bjgxx4/jesus-hasnt-saved-us-young-black-women-returning-ancestral-religions)
However, there is also research documenting Christianity in Africa before colonialism. I certainly don't know what is true yet
and I may never. I guess my question is what lays in the past and how important is it? Many members of the african diaspora
are looking to the past for answers or guidance but at least in this case, there isn't a consistent, definite one. Does the 
possibility that Christianity is as old and integral to Africa as our ancestral religions color the beliefs of someone practicing
the religion of their ancestors now? How important is the past to the future? Are we putting too much weight on the past?

The idea of too much reliance on the past is also something that comes up when I think of how some members of the african diaspora have 
taken to calling each other 'kings' and 'queens' for various reasons, one of them being the belief that Africans are descendants of
kings and queens (Egyptians). In his song Summertime, rapper Vince Staples says: "My teachers told me we were slaves, my mama told me we were 
kings, I don't know who to listen to, I guess we're somewhere in between." In "I can," rapper Nas says "We were kings and queens, 
never porch monkeys." At the end of Black Panther, Kilmonger says "Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors that jumped 
from the ships. Because they knew death was better than bondage." Kilmonger selectively chooses his ancestors to be the ones
that jumped off the ship and not the ones that were enslaved for years. For him, descending from those who he believes to be 
steadfast and brave is important. He is basing the present (who he is) and the future on the past. For him to be the person he is,
he has to be a descendant of the Africans that jumped, not the ones that stayed. This is similar to the whole kings and queens 
thing. The idea that africans are all descendants of kings and queens is a nice one to latch onto but even if it were true it 
would mean we are glazing over centuries of ancestors being slaves (and selling their fellow people as slaves). For Nas and 
Vince Staples, the past is important in defining who they are and can be in the present. 

The last thing I want to mention is in the panel discussion after Phillips talk, the idea of new subjects came up. 
Daniel Rourke said something like it's important to imagine and create a weird future - "the weirder the better so 
they include subjectivities that we haven’t come into contact with.” By subjectivities, some examples he gave were
"different kinds of bodies, sexualities.." Many studies have been done to explore queerness, homosexuality, transgenderism
in ancient times. Often (and I have done this), arguments against homophobia in Africa use the studies that show the 
presence and acceptance of homosexuality before colonial times. Again, the past is used to determine if a present or future 
reality is valid: There can be queerness in the future _if_ there was queerness in the past.
