## Response to In Defense of the Poor Image
[Original article](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/10/61362/in-defense-of-the-poor-image/)

Images respond to a context and a necessity. After the second world war Italian neorealism emerged as an immediate response to the horrors they had just lived. Bombarded cities were their sets, neighbors were actors and expired film ran through discarded journalists cameras. The movies were, technically speaking, low quality, compared to Hollywood's 40s big productions. But in the aftermath of the world there's no time for production development, it's the necessity the tell the world and document what has just happened.

This urge to tell new stories was at core of the laters 60s and 70s new film movements, such as Nouvelle Vague in France, Third Cinema in Latin America but more precisely Cinema Nuovo in Brazil, and New American Cinema in the United States.
This movements prioritized new voices over repeating a technique tradition.

Over time, these disrupting movements became the norm and, probably without even trying to, imposed themselves as a classic style. Black and white film was what they had at hand and could afford. It has now become a sign of artsy and niche. Whatever movement, for much revolt it may cause, will eventually be devoured, adapted and transform by the cultural system. It is our responsibility as artist to provoke these shifts in norms but also to question and abandon them as appropriation begins.
