The Rasheeda Philips talk on "Black Quantum Futurism" gave some very interesting history of the cultural specificities of various notions of time, and the origins of time constructs that are now widely considered common-sensical, contrary to how they were perceived when new. However, having listened to it, it's not clear to me so far what implications this information has for my behavior. The mutual influence among conceptions of the past, present, and future has been clear to me for some years, hence my continual insistence on naming the true, ugly history of the US, and my attempts to imagine a better future, without capitalism, prisons or police as we know them.

A note on media: I find video a difficult medium for study due to the inherent difficulties, either in skimming past what I already know or find unintersting, or in lingering over difficult aspects, at least when the video is (as is typical) unaccompanied by a transcript or hyperlinked outline. For example, I wish it was easier for me to revisit the speaker's words about Frederick Douglass's speech "What to the slave is your Fourth of July?", which I have read many times, but after my first listen I didn't have time to find again when she mentioned it. Besides my affinity for (hyper-)text, I've found mediums such as music, like Digable Planets' "Reachin': A New Refutation of Time and Space", to be more suitable than words alone to convey alternative ways to conceptualize time and the implications of our consciousness of time for our actions. Repetitive and cyclical aspects of time, as well as the need to hold many things and their mutual influences simultaneously, are expressed very naturally and intuitively (to me, at least, probably because I've played and studied music since I was a child) in the form in a way that I found a linear English lecture about nonlinear time ironically failed to do.
