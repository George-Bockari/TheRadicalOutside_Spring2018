"Obviously, a high-resolution image looks more brilliant and impressive, more mimetic and magic, more scary and seductive than a poor one. It is more rich, so to speak."

This assertion only holds up to a certain amount of resolution, at which point images are of such high resolution that they show more than the eye can see and start to degrade in the opposite direction. For example, some of the newer high-resolution television monitors have started to outpace fiction. Their resolution is so good that they make the content look cheap, overlit and exposed. We are no longer looking at the flattering light of the flagship store or the exclusive dinner party, but the moment when the overheads have been turned on, and the dirty curtains are shown.

I find it interesting that increasingly higher resolution images are sold as an unquestionable good. This raises the question, where does it end? Does it end at the limits of the human eye? Or, do we start to use augmented seeing devices for "regular" seeing. We are already using VR headsets for a type of playful experience, but with augmented reality, images are being freed from their screens and into the world: the whole frame is being dissolved. 

Another development as resolution increases over time is that previously accessible images now look grainy, "low-res", almost impossible to believe we watched on TVs.  The effect of this is that as resolution increases, I am less able to see things I used to see, as I used to see them.  As resolution improves, memory degrades and the past goes out of focus. With a de-focused past, we are forced to live in an increasingly "brighter" and ever-more-intensely vibrating present. 

And yet at the exact same moment, while everyone is buying mega-resolution televisions and watching movies in XD, internet memes--images that are the exact opposite of this--are making a huge comeback and are having an outsized impact on politics and social discourse, while at the same time being dismissed by many in more traditional media roles as "not having any value within the class society".  

So we are living in a moment of exagerration. A heightened, super-human seeing that breaks down comfortable illusions of fiction; and simultaneously an upsurge in low-quality degraded content that is "creating anonymous global networks" while evading the critique of the class society because they are seen as "on the outside". 

What to make of this simultaneous enhancement and degradation? One thing is that both directions are taking us away from the present moment where we see things as they are. They are both pornography of the image in certain ways: exaggerating certain compelling qualities in order to create an immersive and addictive experience of those qualities.  

Is experiencing the present moment, through ways of seeing, becoming a type of pornography?

And yet, "the poor image thus constructs anonymous global networks just as it creates a shared history. It builds alliances as it travels, provokes translation or mistranslation, and creates new publics and debates. By losing its visual substance it recovers some of its political punch and creates a new aura around it. "

Describing Twitter: "Poor images are thus popular imagesâ€”images that can be made and seen by the many. They express all the contradictions of the contemporary crowd: its opportunism, narcissism, desire for autonomy and creation, its inability to focus or make up its mind, its constant readiness for transgression and simultaneous submission. Altogether, poor images present a snapshot of the affective condition of the crowd, its neurosis, paranoia, and fear, as well as its craving for intensity, fun, and distraction. The condition of the images speaks not only of countless transfers and reformattings, but also of the countless people who cared enough about them to convert them over and over again, to add subtitles, reedit, or upload them."
