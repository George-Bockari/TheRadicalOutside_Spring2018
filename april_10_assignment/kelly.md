## In Defense of the Poor Image response

I'm not sure I like the definition of repeatedly reproduced memes as being "poor images." I suppose if this is discussed in the framework of a dichotomy between these memes and "rich images" and "perfect cinema," then I guess it makes sense. I would hesitate to apply a class-based metaphor to this media but I do tend to agree that "rich media" now has a reactionary vibe. It smells of the desire to retreat back to the so-called "high end" quality of art and imagery. Media tends to change over time, and in Benjamin's age of mechanical (digital) reproduction, I think it makes more sense to succumb to new art forms that may seem "lower end" than stick to something antiquated and stick up your nose at anything else. 
The closing sentence struck me the most: "In short, it is about reality." This reminds me of how Richard Dawkins described memes, setting aside for a minute the fact that I hate Richard Dawkins. He compared the dispersion of thoughts and ideas to genetics in a Darwinian fashion. Steyerl compares it not to biology but to sociology - swarm circulation, defiance, appropriation etc. basically the way people can treat any concept, thing, or fellow person, the "real conditions of existence." This is all in contrast to the static form of "rich media" that isn't really meant to propagate organically, it's supposed to be a Thing _intended_ to be stationary and unchanging, like a grave marker.
