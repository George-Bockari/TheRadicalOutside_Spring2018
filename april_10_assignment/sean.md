# Responding to In Defense of the Poor Image

Maybe it's just my mood right now, but the argument the author made with this essay feels annoyingly tired. The drawn out romanticization of film quality evokes the image of scribes huddled in their cloisters, aghast at the spread of literacy. A more current comparison could be the stress journalists feel with the proliferation of social media and blogs. In fact, it's almost that exact same argument, with different vocabulary â€” vocabulary that fixates a bit too literally on image quality. The point comes across (slowly), but that fixation makes the author's argument read like the begrudging acknowledgment of the future by a old, grumpy elite.

And wrapping the essay up with "It's about reality"? Come on. 

But maybe I'm unsympathetic because my craft isn't going through a huge disruption in the way it's consumed and created. I might write an essay like this when writing code becomes commonplace. But amongst the crappy blogs, we get things like The Pudding. And among the 'poor image' cinema, we get the films of Sean Baker. That's a good thing.
