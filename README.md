**Course description**

This is a theory course for critical thinking of technology through the lens of activism, politics, and the 'outside'; to think and create beyond technology for technology's sake; to ask difficult questions; to read, learn, and engage in technology as a field of contemporary art practices and theories, as well as art historical systems. What will separate this course from many others is a collective effort (by all of us) for 'reflective thinking'; to not find comfort in how - up to this very day - the story of technology is told to us; by which figures and which systems. I hope that together we can build a new library of critical thinking and reading; written and processed by women (+LGBT) and POC.  This is a collaborative course for interrupting and re-building.

**Expectations and Structure**

* Each week, there will be a guest speaker who will introduce a topic. We will focus on a combination of historical and contemporary text.
* Each week students should come to class ready to read their stories and assignments (more on that soon).
* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant. Please see here for [presentation guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtTwy6yakti5TaYL_oq0sgZo-mZSv_RGKruh3tff1m0/edit?usp=sharing).
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts. Think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading or find other related material or resources that can juxtapose or compare the reading to something else you find relevant.
* Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers is essential.
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all phones off.
Best policy for laptop use: laptops down.
* Classroom hygiene
* Best policy for speaking up, listening in



Schedule (Please keep an eye on the schedule in this document every week). This is under construction and will be changed throughout the course. Please feel free to give feedback.

**Homework**
Please submit to the github the night before our class (Monday, March 12)


*Prompt 1:* It's the year 2050. You are arguing in front of the Supreme Court in favor of increasing surveillance.

- agnes, eunsun, hans, nabil, yeli, phil, riley, sean, sukanya

*Prompt 2:* It's the year 2050. You are arguing in front of the Supreme Court in favor of regulating the surveillance reach of the government (and the private companies they hire)

- ailadi, gonza, kelly, fame, paola, rachel, sarah, syd, yael

For both prompts, speculate about 1) the state of world affairs, 2) the technologies that exist or are being developed, 3) the political climate in the US, and anywhere else your imagination takes you.

- Please limit your answers to 600 words maximum.

- Please come to class ready to read your story. Practice reading it a bit before the class so you can read it smoothly.

- We will be recording your readings to be used at the end of the semester for our podcast. You do not need to worry about that right now since we will do all the final decision making and editings the last 2 weeks of the semester together. This is just a heads-up that we will record this material for the podcast.
