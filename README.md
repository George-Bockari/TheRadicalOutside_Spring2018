**Course description**

This is a theory course for critical thinking of technology through the lens of activism, politics, and the 'outside'; to think and create beyond technology for technology's sake; to ask difficult questions; to read, learn, and engage in technology as a field of contemporary art practices and theories, as well as art historical systems. What will separate this course from many others is a collective effort (by all of us) for 'reflective thinking'; to not find comfort in how - up to this very day - the story of technology is told to us; by which figures and which systems. I hope that together we can build a new library of critical thinking and reading; written and processed by women (+LGBT) and POC.  This is a collaborative course for interrupting and re-building.


**Expectations and Structure**

* Each week, there will be a guest speaker who will introduce a topic. We will focus on a combination of historical and contemporary text.
*Each week students should come to class ready to read their stories and assignments (more on that soon).
* Read all the material and come prepared to discuss it in depth. Please bring other resources, authors and artists that you find relevant. Please see here for [presentation guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtTwy6yakti5TaYL_oq0sgZo-mZSv_RGKruh3tff1m0/edit?usp=sharing).
* Blog weekly about the readings and your thoughts. Think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading or find other related material or resources that can juxtapose or compare the reading to something else you find relevant.
* Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers is essential.
* As this is primarily a discussion-based class, let's have all phones off.
Best policy for laptop use: guidelines
* Classroom hygiene
* Best policy for speaking up, listening in
