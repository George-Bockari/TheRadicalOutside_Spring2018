Honorable Judges. 

I thank you for this opportunity to speak before you today... once again, about <i>"surveillance"</i>.

I think it is time for us to re-frame the argument. Surveillance, as we knew it, implied an unequal power structure, but this has changed in the past decade. What we are talking about today is <i><b> data collection </b></i> -- data that is authentic, verifiable, secure, transparent and decentralized. It is with this data that we have managed to speed up our judicial system, prevent disease outbreak, and distribute resources. This data has paved the way for greater efficiency, and subsequently, sustainability. We are projected to be amongst the top 10 greenest nations by 2065. 

It is also with this data that our artificial-intelligence systems function as well as they do, free from the issues of bias that plagued them in the early days. Now any ordinary citizen can test and verify the effectiveness of our AI systems, without any specialized knowledge. These systems have contributed to the safer world we live in today, with reduced crime, reduced corruption and reduced disease & illness.

Further, decades old psychological studies have shown that changes in <i>behavior</i> lead to changes in <i>attitude</i>. We can observe the behavioral change due to our data collection schemes, and tools such as HumanBook, that have made our predictive profiles open and accessible to all -- people take more responsibility for their actions and their impact on society, knowing that they do not act in secrecy. This has lead to a shift in attitude -- attitudes towards immigrants and minority groups has measurably changed for the better; citizens' trust in the government is also measurably higher as government officials can no longer carry out the shady deals and corrupt practices of the past. 

We need to extend these schemes to newer technologies, and set policy in place that allows for frictionless expansion of these data-collection schemes as our technologies continue to develop. We embraced a data-driven way of life almost a half-century back, and we must look at these issues with fresh eyes, and re-frame the conversation based on the todays landscape.
