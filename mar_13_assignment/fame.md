### It's the year 2050. You are arguing in front of the Supreme Court *in favor of regulating* the surveillance reach of the government

Nowadays, in the year of 2050 that some people could preserve consciousness to digital form and download to an artificial body. We’re the first generation to have this ability to remain in the thing government called perfect body, an eternity which digital and physical identity merge into a new form.

However, since we can upload one's consciousness and run our digital trails, data of physical behaviors, and connect the old body through some algorithm. Then the government knows every single thing a person has done in the past and collected in the database.

Particularly to begin with, since this current model makes government be the only exclusive host that keep data to all the citizens. The government will become a dominance who can use this information in such a way that they want. For example, The government shakes hand with the insurance company to sell the high-security package for the perfect body service. Only exclusive high-class who can afford to buy it can have high protect data which creates the massive unequal to the society.

Moreover, there's a risk that third party could take the data. If some people could manage to pay for accessing the database, or if there’s the digital terrorist, who would hack the data and steal or sell someone identity that would be terrifying. Instead of secure our life it becomes open up the possibility to be attacked individually or collectively become vulnerable as in the national scale as well.  

Many people still not agree to use the service provided by the government so when a body unusable they have to give up the consciousness.
