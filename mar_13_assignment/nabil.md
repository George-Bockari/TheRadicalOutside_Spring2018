Your Honors, it is crucial that we increase surveillance if we are to have any hope of keeping these United States intact.

When our founding fathers created this nation, they knew it was necessary to keep a close eye on the native peoples they were murdering and displacing, as well as the enslaved Africans they were enslaving to do all of the useful work of the society, so they had time to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
If we are to have any hope of continuing to be the people who enjoy that legacy, we have to keep a closer eye on these rebellious prisons, reservations and regions.

It is true what the opposing counsel says that the fourth amendment to our great constitution states "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated."
But based on history, we all know which people the framers of the Constitution were talking about.
If Black people, Native Americans, Muslims, and Asians didn't have a right to privacy and security then, why should they now?
It is for good reason that the 13th amendment preserved slavery once we have convicted these people of the crimes they are of course guilty of.
At this point, just as the Dred Scott decision said, these beings of an inferior order have no rights we as white men and diverse others are bound to respect.

We all know that "the Constitution is not a suicide pact."
To fail to closely observe the indigenous and Black people who are taking control of the land that rightfully belongs to us, the descendants of the settlers and pioneers who took it, would be an unforgivable sin against the manifest destiny of this nation.
And if we lose control of this land and its resources, what are we left with?
The tender mercies of the people we've been tormenting for generations?
Surely the justices understand that such a scenario would be as unpleasant for each of you as it would be for us.
After all, how would you feel if you were in their position?
What might you try to do about it?

There is only one way to find out, and prevent it: more surveillance.
Make the right decision.
For yourself and for your children.
