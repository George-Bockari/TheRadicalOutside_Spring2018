##It's the year 2050. You are arguing in front of the Supreme Court in favor of 
increasing surveillance.

In the Dark Knight, Lucius Fox build a mass surveillance system to spy on Gotham City's citizens using 
video and mobile phone technology. Batman (Bruce Wayne) used a super computer that uses sonar 
technology to spy on the citizens of Gotham to find the criminal Joker. Despite Fox threatening to quit 
over the use of such a technology because it violated the citizens personal privacy along with its ethical 
implications in using such a system of surveillance. Bruce Wayne argued that it was necessary to catch 
Joker. 

Eventually, Fox's spy system was a success and brought peace and safe to the citizens of Gotham city. 
What about WayneÕs argument for using such a form of mass surveillance? While at the same time 
denying Fox and his ethical dilemma about his hesitation to use it. Would Gotham City have been saved 
even at the expense of such moral and ethical implications?

In my opinion, I think the idea of increasing surveillance for the sake of public safety should be imposed 
legally with an approval by the citizens among the governments for the sake of reducing criminal 
behavior, crime, and which itself does carry ethical implications with regards to civil liberties for the sake 
of national security. Even though tracking and monitoring people's lives makes for an increase in safety 
and sense of security. It does postulate the violation of certain ethical principles among nations. 

Through surveillance technology keep developing, finally, we can operate a security system for tracking 
ID and recording crime. Therefore, we should utilize this technology for reducing criminal activity. IÕm 
sure that surveillance do help to prevent crimes. But we have to be critical in using it. Where it can be 
misused as written in an article called "Surveillance as a tool for racism", the use of racial profiling and 
labeling someone as a criminal rooted in prejudice and racism. Although being watched changes how you 
move, how you think, how one acts. It is reminded of what Michel Foucault once illustrated; The way we 
are harassed and stalked creates a prison of the mind. Where the extent of massive surveillance can make 
as psychological prison which impedes freedom of movement having constantly being observed.

Moreover, capitalism has brought a sense of imbalance in society in terms of Marxist trajectories in 
relation to the problems of surveillance. Today, surveillance is used by the powerful to protect their 
property. In this system, protecting property becomes more important than protecting human freedom and 
liberties. Because property is considered more important than people in our society, this creates a desire to 
accumulate goods. But, if the less wealthy are empowered to surveillance the wealthy, we will see clearly 
how much injustice there is in society. 

In Korea, a man who has a disability was falsely charged for decades. There weren't any evidences which 
proved the charge for murder. The authorities needed a criminal for several reasons and the suspect had to 
confess through the measure coercion. If surveillance had existed, then the police and lawmakers would 
also have to be held to account. Their illegal tactics would be exposed and there would be no false 
imprisonment. Humans in general have made a lot of nefarious and impulsive mistakes by their thinking 
among certain situations which should be carefully examined with sound evidence before any measure of 
prosecution. Complete surveillance is necessary to protect the vulnerable Ðthe poor, the disabled, and 
other minorities- from those who are in power.
