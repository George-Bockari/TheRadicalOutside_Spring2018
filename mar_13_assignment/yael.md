## Human Algorithms

Collecting data in the occupied territories relied on gathering field work on the ground in dense neighborhoods with endless alleys, and connecting the dots. Entering homes late at night, pulling men outside while children cry. Driving military jeeps away after such operations, angered local youth stoned military jeeps and undercover vehicles.

Informants arrived late at night at the base. They were often brought in through the back, into a suite of a few rooms that none of us ever got to enter. Human algorithms delivering information in exchange of protection. Outside of a screeching door, which took long seconds to close as if someone set it to slow-motion, was a doorbell. No label. The stairwell was always cold– probably a result of the broken glass window on the second floor.

The combination of a court, policing units, and people in civil attire, all within a military base, resulted in multiple systems through which to navigate one’s way around. On court days, we knew not to walk across the main gate, lest we be summoned to perform a body search on local women. Most of these women came to sit on narrow wood benches at hearings of their relatives– sons, husbands, brothers.

Trials happened inside the Mukataa, a building originally built during the British Mandate as a Tegart fort, policing headquarters. On the second floor, right above the court, were our bedrooms. Over the years, this massive architectural structure served governmental offices and headquarters of different regimes that occupied the land: the British, Jordanians, and later the Palestinian Authority. It was never ours.

The only thing that was ours was the questionable privilege to fall asleep one floor above a hall in which a judge determined fates and confiscated dreams. At times, walking outside the court, one could hear mourning of women whose family members were sentenced that day.

On the back side of the base, three modular containers created a small courtyard around nothing. Depending on the weather, the surroundings shifted from sticky mud to dense dust penetrating one’s nostrils without permission.

Two modulars were used as admin offices. The third one was locked. It only opened in the small hours of night during arrest operations. Dozens of men were brought in, hands tied behind their backs into a room. Only a small desk and one chair in the room. No heat nor ventilation to combat the sour smell. Emotional and mental fear turned urine. Fragments of someone who until a few hours ago was a father, a brother. Those lucky enough to be sent home as soon as daylight arrived were dropped off outside the main gate. Their home could be a refugee camp a few hours walk away. Others kept for further questioning were escorted in daylight, their eyes covered, into the jail.

The moment a transfer became available, I left. I never went back. Years later, I moved out of the country.
