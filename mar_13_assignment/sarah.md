It's funny that we're meeting here. Plants everywhere. This old room. It's just a projection, really, the old bench isn't even connected anymore. 

Washington D.C -- such a construct, now just a jungle. There were no buildings taller than the capitol and the trees haven't made it that height yet either, but they will. 

You nine, but not all of you. And me, near ninety, but not all of me. 

What has American become? It's 30 years out, we're just in a jar, realy, America has become a terrarium on someone else's desk. 

All the watching we did and now we are the watched. 

So my argument, and your decision, won't amount to much more than closing a window shade, but let's do it, for old time's sake. Ritual helps. 

At the start of the century, two fuel-injected jets flew into the Twin Towers. 19 Saudi nationals were in those jets and afterwards, we chose to look elsewhere. We chose to exercise our very clear right to not see. For we were both a seeing country and a blind one.  I guess we saw what we wanted to see. 

We wanted to live in a the glass ball on the wizard's sceptre, protected and sun-warmed, from the designated "You". "You". The pepole who didn't have nice couches, good manners, inside voices.  

We were all about watching. We watched "you", from fortified flourescent hallways, and for those of us that were "the good guys", we watched ourselves.  We made television shows of "reality": lab experiments using the highly emotional, close-quartered desperate. 

Those were our gladiator shows, with their shelves of mid-grade prizes, pink and yellow tabloid covers, money you were bound to lose, injectable faces and yellow hair. The houses we stored them in didn't get to the main roads, but they had running water and exquisite bathrooms. 

For ourselves we kept the best technology. To "augment" our own reality. By flying in little hallucinogenic butterflies that we could see with the tiniest of glases, then eventually contacts, then eventually implants.  

We brought others back from the dead, not cryogenically re-heated but in images that moved. We wore heavy black helmets to meet in imaginary worlds.  That was a time, wasn't it.  Our beetle-limbs flailing under our headsets, chasing balls and sunny days like twitching, sleeping animals. 

At the same time we learned to pry fact off rock, like pesky barnacles. It was easy to create photographs and video - initially evidentiary artificats - out of imaginary scenarios. Where once we called these "movies" and went into dark halls to enjoy them, we started calling them "news events". And instead of people we recongized as "the players" we say images of people we'd known as "the real ones". 

It had been easy enough thorugh splintering of channels, to introduce forgetfulness and distraction, states of being that allowed you to let things go with a puzzled look. Like when we think we hear an intruder at night but it's just the "house settling".  You were the house settling. 

These sounds that startled us became "nothing". Once we were distratced we needed fun, which led to better, more immersive tools, and more omni-present channels, and by this time the lack of a central narrative, well, we'd known long before that single narratives couldn't be trusted.  

Why were we surprised that the facts fell so easily. Why were any of us surprised. 

So "we", the designated "citizens", watched the "reality people". The reality people watched the celebrities. The celebrities watched themselves. "The News" was the State. The State watched the poor people and kept "them" in check. Our technocrats watched us watching.
