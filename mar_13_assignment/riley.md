**_AURORA LIVE:  BRINGING YOU THE TRUTH._**

_Welcome back to coverage of our Principal Deputy Director of National Security's appeal of the recent ruling to restrict biosurveillance of minors._

…these networks are designed by their creators with certain unbreakable contracts, among which are objectivity, data security, and steady refinement. We hold these truths to be self-evident. The Logic Party ran on the premise that we need Liberty 2.0; that a concept of "Freedom" without freedom of data is outmoded. Since the corporate sector opened employee metrics our economy has rebounded. But once again, legacy legal systems are slowing our party's ability to make the same types of improvements. We can see that…

…old laws, still governing technology we could not have dreamed of thirty years ago. If we've learned anything, it's that progress is not a linear process. In just two years, Cypress has reached its hundred-thousanth iteration, with new improvements automatically built in at each generation. The formula is simple: with more data, our predictionss become more powerful.

…we hardly have time to be discussing this. All metrics show that crime is on the rise in areas that Cypress has found to be hotspots. And it doesn't matter what model we run this on; of our ten representative demographic segments, everyone objectively benefits from these proposed improvements in biosurveillance capability.

During the federal hearing we heard the need for greater transparency. We agree! Only by adding more inputs can we be sure that everyone's protected under our security network. You know how these things work – Cypress has designed an effective system, and although we can't audit the design directly, we can logically prove its trustworthiness; it was designed from the first generation with principles of fairness in mind.

So yes, we began seeding Cypress with a small amount of data before we'd cleared all the red tape. But based on readings from those same reports, we can easily prove that this is what the people want. As we stand here today, we speak for the sentiments of America. This is the only logical decision.
