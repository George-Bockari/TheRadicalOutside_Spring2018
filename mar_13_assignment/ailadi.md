Dear past 2018,

I’m sorry to inform you that as desperately as you were fearing, predictive policing established itself as a “matter of fact” or “data”, as you might remember the terminology they used to sold us this innovative and performative ‘neutral’ security. Proactive became the new buzz word to ensure a cleaner world. All citizen are required to collaborate and submit any irregular data and suspicious activity, to the BAN, the Bureau of Anomalies Notification. Not submitting is considered a crime.

Health & Safeguard of Brain Company (HSBC) is a private company that collaborate with the government in preserving the established security of US citizens. The company does so by monitoring the health state of every citizen and preventing people in state of mental instability to commit acts that might endanger public security. Multi functional ear plugs are used as data collector being these already in contact with the brain to enable augmented sight. 

Today it’s Monday 21st of February and we are at the Supreme Court where the legal representative of Mrs Elway is accusing HSBC, Health & Safeguard of Brain Company, of omission of succor and so murder of her husband. 
What Attorney White — the legal defense of HSBC —  sustain,  is that, quoting his words: “the fact that HSBC knows about the psychic state of its citizen doesn’t make it accountable if it doesn’t take actions to prevent those people from committing suicide. HSBC role is to monitor the health of its citizen with the intent to detect threats to the community.“

The case seemed lost in the beginning but the legal accuser attacked HSBC not for omission of succors but for not filing an alert notice to the BAN when they monitored an abnormal activity in Mr. Elway’s brain in the few hours anticipating the suicide. 

The case is followed by critics and protestors all over the state reviving much of the debate created by the introduction of Brain surveillance. There are different factions, the ones opposing to brainwave monitoring, the ones demanding for government responsibilities as in the case of the death of Mr. White and those concerned that this case might just path the way to a further restriction of citizen liberty, like that of committing suicide.
