Response to [In Defense of the Poor Image](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/10/61362/in-defense-of-the-poor-image/) by Hito Steyerl:

The essay is very provoking thoughts while makes me feel ambivalence about the poor image.
Steyerl gives us an ontological of 'the poor image.' Nowadays, since the users-end doesn't seem to be a matter where the pics, clips, or gifs come from, the essay reminds me of growing up as the analog transform to the digital generation. As Steyerl mentions when the videos are rare, high quality and exclusive and if ones could have enough afford, they can own it. People are willing to pay for artifacts that contain data, political status, and maybe social status to it. The high cost then very much a consequence of the expensive high production, created by experts and again EXCLUSIVE.

*"The poor image is an illicit fifth-generation bastard of an original image."*
As the archives, data, images become accessible to both makers and consumers. Is this a freedom!? Think twice, this might be not related but similar situation on how music industry needs to change by the digital age, as streaming become a norm and their time and creations swap with very little money. Did we get spoil from the past era?

*"Poor images are poor because they are heavily compressed and travel quickly. They lose matter and gain speed."*
The transformation of the digital form, from hi-definition to poor image is also very fascinating. The crown source editing?  What's happened in between? People and societies developed the digital experience to shape our perception as the no-wait state, which also in general set out attention span to be shorter. It's not just the image degraded, we too, in some way. Besides, as the file converted, compressed, it is crucial that we're being aware of how the contents, titles, contexts have been twisted or altered.
